# English-Learning-Website
This student-centered platform is designed to facilitate English language learning through three specialized types of lessons:
1. Vocabulary-Based Lessons: Students can search for word meanings, with the system providing accurate definitions if the word exists in the database. If the word is not found, a "no result found" message is displayed, ensuring clarity and focused learning.
2. Grammar-Based Lessons: These lessons delve into the fundamentals of grammar, specifically focusing on parts of speech such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, and more. This structured approach helps students build a strong grammatical foundation.
3. Sentence Structure Lessons: Aimed at enhancing sentence construction skills, these lessons differentiate between sentence types like exclamatory, assertive, and interrogative, using clear sentence examples to reinforce understanding.

To further support student learning, a dedicated quiz section is available to test and reinforce the knowledge gained from each lesson type. The quizzes are designed to be interactive and provide immediate feedback, helping students track their progress.

The platform also includes an "About Me" page, which introduces the teachers and provides insight into their qualifications and teaching philosophy. This fosters a connection between students and instructors, enhancing the overall learning experience.

The website is intuitively structured with key navigational pages, including "Home," "Lessons," "Quiz," and "About Me," ensuring that students can easily access all the features and resources available. This seamless interface is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly learning environment.
